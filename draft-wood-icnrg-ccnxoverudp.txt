1.  Introduction

   To enable interoperability between CCNx forwarder implementations
   over UDP [RFC0768], one can create virtual links between endpoints to
   exchange CCNx messages (see Figure 1).

   |F1+-------------------+F2|

   Figure 1: A virtual link between two CCNx-compliant forwarders F1 and
                                    F2.

   The goal of this document is to prescribe exactly how to transport
   CCNx messages between two CCNx-compliant forwarders over UDP
   [RFC0768] instead of directly over layer-2 Ethernet.  Virtual links
   created over UDP must be secured by DTLS [RFC6347].  By default, DTLS
   provides (P)MTU size and fragmentation.  Extensions enable keep-alive
   messages to be integrated [RFC6520], but this is not a default
   feature.  Consequently, the solution for running CCNx over UDP (DTLS)
   is to add keep-alive messages using link local names.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used in this document.

   Link local name: a name that is used in Interest messages that are
   only meant to traverse a single hop between two forwarders over a
   link.

2.  Transport Assumptions and Requirements

   We make the following assumptions about UDP as transport protocol.

   o  UDP is an unreliable datagram service (i.e., best-effort datagram
      delivery).

   o  Maximum MTU size of 4KB

   o  UDP (via DTLS) or IP fragmentation subsumes CCNx fragmentation
      (which would be required for communication over layer-2 services.

   Moreover, running CCNx over UDP between two forwarders requires DTLS
   to be implemented at both forwarders.  CCNx messages will not
   traverse unsecured links between nodes.

3.  Specification

   This section outlines the information necessary for an implementation
   of the CCNx protocol to connect and communicate with a CCNx-compliant
   forwarder over UDP.  The technique is simple: CCNx messages are
   encapsulated in the payload of (DTLS-protected) UDP packets, as shown
   below.

   +----+-----+--------------------------------------+
   | IP | UDP | DTLS |      CCNx Packet              |
   +----+--------------------------------------------+
                     \_____________||________________/
                                   \/
                    +---------------------------------+
                    | Headers |  Message | Validation |
                    +---------------------------------+

           Figure 2: CCNx message encapsulation in UDP packets.

   Upon successful receipt of a UDP packet from one forwarder to
   another, a virtual link will have been established.  This link is
   uniquely defined by the four-element tuple (SrcAddress, DstAddress,
   SrcPort, DstPort).  Constructing virtual or overlay links that are
   multiplexed onto a single UDP link is not supported.  The default UDP
   port for both the source and destination are 9596.

3.1.  Options

   Running CCNx over UDP with DTLS enabled solves many problems that
   would have to be directly addressed, including MTU size discovery or
   agreement, and fragmentation.  CCNx forwarders rely on DTLS to
   provide these two features.

   Keep-alive messages are only supported in DTLS if the extension in
   [RFC6520] is implemented.  Since this is not a standard feature of
   DTLS, CCNx forwarders must use their own keep-alive mechanism.  CCNx
   forwarders will use the heartbeat resource specified in [LINKLOCAL]
   to periodically issue keep-alive messages at a rate of 1 message per
   second.  Such a keep-alive message will be a CCNx Interest with the
   name

   lci:/link/local/<identifier>/heartbeat/GET

   where identifier is a random 32-bit identifier that the _sender_
   generates and associates with the target link.  The response to this
   Interest is a Content Object with an empty payload, which serves as
   an acknowledgement of its receipt.

   To avoid conflict, both forwarders must periodically send keep-alive
   messages at the same rate (1 message per second).  A peer forwarder
   will be considered unavailable if no keep-alive message is sent from
   the peer in 5 seconds.  When a peer is determined to be unavailable
   by a forwarder, the link to said peer will be destroyed and its
   resources will be freed.  Moreover, the DTLS session will be torn
   down.  Both peers must re-initialize a DTLS session if they are to
   continue using the link.

4.  Security Considerations

   All UDP links are secured via DTLS.  Issues of peer authentication
   and trust management in the DTLS protocol are outside the scope of
   this document.
